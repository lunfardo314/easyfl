# EasyFL
**EasyFL** stands for **Easy** **F**ormula **L**anguage or **Easy** **F**unctional **L**anguage. 
It is a very simple functional programming language. It is extendable and portable. 
It also defines binary code format. Its primary use is definition of finite constraints of bounded data structures. 
In other words, the computational model of the language is non-Turing equivalent and only can describe validity 
constraints of static data structures with known bounds, i.e. circuits.

Here is a [preliminary presentation](https://hackmd.io/@Evaldas/S14WHOKMi) of the **EasyFL** language
