# EasyFL
**EasyFL** stands for **Easy** **F**ormula **L**anguage or **Easy** **F**unctional **L**anguage. 
It is a very simple functional programming language. It is extendable, platform-independent, minimalistic and readable. 
It defines a *canonic *binary code format. Its primary use is definition of finite constraints of bounded data structures, such as UTXO transaction.

The computational model of the language is non-Turing equivalent and only can describe validity 
constraints of static data structures with known bounds, i.e. circuits. This makes it possible automatic proofs and validation 
of of the data structures constrained by the _EasyFL_ constraints.

Here is a [preliminary presentation](https://hackmd.io/@Evaldas/S14WHOKMi) of the **EasyFL** language
